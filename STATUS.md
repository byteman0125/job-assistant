## 🧪 What Needs Testing

### Priority 1: Test Each Platform
1. **Start scraping**
2. **Open console** (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
3. **Watch for each platform's output**:
   ```
   Himalayas: Navigating to...
   Himalayas: Found X job listings
   Himalayas: Saved job - Company - Title
   ```

### Priority 2: Update Selectors
If a platform shows "Found 0 job listings":
1. Open that platform's website in browser
2. Right-click a job → Inspect
3. Find correct selectors
4. Update in **Actions** tab
5. Save and restart scraping

### Priority 3: Add Cookies (Optional)
For platforms with login or bot detection:
1. Login to platform in browser
2. Copy cookies (F12 → Application → Cookies)
3. Paste in **Cookies** tab
4. Format: `[{"name":"cookie_name","value":"cookie_value"}]`

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### When Working Correctly:

**Console Output:**
```
Database initialized
Himalayas: Browser initialized
Himalayas: Navigating to https://himalayas.app/jobs...
Himalayas: Found 15 job listings
Himalayas: Processing job 1/15
Himalayas: Saved job - Acme Corp - Senior Developer
Himalayas: Saved job - Tech Co - Full Stack Engineer
...
RemoteOK: Browser initialized
RemoteOK: Found 20 job listings
...
```

**UI:**
- Status: "● Running" (green)
- "X jobs today" badge increases
- Jobs table fills with new entries
- System tray shows notification

**Database:**
- Location: `C:\Users\byteb\AppData\Roaming\job-searcher\jobs.db`
- Jobs saved with all fields populated
- No duplicates (same company+title)

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Platform finds 0 jobs
**Solution**: Website structure changed → Update selectors in Actions tab

### Issue: "Navigation timeout"
**Solution**: Website slow or blocking → Add cookies or increase delays

### Issue: Too many duplicates
**Solution**: This is expected! Database automatically rejects duplicates

### Issue: Scraper hangs
**Solution**: Stop scraping → Update problematic platform → Restart

### Issue: ChatGPT not loading
**Solution**: Add fresh ChatGPT cookies → Refresh webview

---

## 📊 Performance Expectations

- **Speed**: 5-20 jobs per platform per cycle
- **Cycle Time**: ~30 minutes for all 7 platforms
- **Daily Yield**: 200-500 jobs (varies by platform availability)
- **Memory**: 150-300 MB
- **CPU**: 5-15% while scraping, <1% idle

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Add New Platform
1. Create `src/main/scrapers/platforms/newplatform.js`
2. Extend `BaseScraper` class
3. Implement `scrape()` method
4. Add to `scraperManager.js`
5. Update UI dropdowns

### Adjust Scraping Speed
Edit delays in `baseScraper.js`:
```javascript
await this.randomDelay(2000, 5000);  // Change these values
```

### Change Scraping Interval
Edit `scraperManager.js`:
```javascript
await this.delay(30 * 60 * 1000);  // Current: 30 minutes
```

## 📦 Building for Production

### Create Installer
```bash
npm run build        # All platforms
npm run build:win    # Windows .exe
npm run build:mac    # macOS .dmg
npm run build:linux  # Linux .AppImage/.deb
```

Output in: `dist/` folder

### Before Building:
1. ✅ Test all platforms
2. ✅ Update icons in `assets/`
3. ✅ Update version in `package.json`
4. ✅ Test on target OS
